# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As no releases have been created for the repository, any and all vulnerabilities will be fixed immediately upon discovery.
The table below shows any versions with known security vulnerability within them. 
As of writing, SharpEngine does not support fixing outdated versions. We ask you to update to the latest versions for any and all security related fixes.

reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
