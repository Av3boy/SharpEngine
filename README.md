# SharpEngine
SharpEngine is a game engine written in purely in C# using [OpenTK.net](https://opentk.net) as a wrapper for the graphics rendering pipeline.

## Repository contents
Currently, the project is in it's infant phase where just the basic components have been implemented.

The following components are missing for the engine to be in a MVP version:
TBD

### Core and example game
The `Core` project is the actual game engine logic. The `Minecraft` project contains an example of what the engine is capable of and how a game can be built using the engine. 

Do note: The contributors of this repository do not have much experience when it comes to game engine / graphics development.
This repository is mainly a hobby project that is going to evolve over time.
