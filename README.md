# SharpEngine
SharpEngine is a game engine written in purely in C# using [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) as a wrapper for the graphics rendering pipeline.

## Repository contents
The [Game Engine Architecture by Jason Gregory](https://www.gameenginebook.com/) contains a [figure](https://www.gameenginebook.com/figures.html) with most if not all the Core features a game engine should contain. 

SharpEngine's first version should contain all necessary components that enable outside developers to build and publish their own games. For further details about the contents of the MVP version see [SharpEngine MVP milestone](https://github.com/Av3boy/SharpEngine/milestone/1) and [the Sharp plan](https://github.com/users/Av3boy/projects/5).

SharpEngine is currently in it's infant phase and contains a small amount of functionalities / components. The items from the project issue list will be introduced incrementally but the timing of said items is unknown due to time constraints.

### Core and example game
The `Core` project is the actual game engine logic. The `Minecraft` project contains an example of what the engine is capable of and how a game can be built using the engine. 

Do note: The contributors of this repository do not have much experience when it comes to game engine / graphics development.
This repository is mainly a hobby project that is going to evolve over time.

The developer experience of the project is currently the no. 2 priority after the main functionalities of the engine to ensure developers find developing using the engine enjoyable.
